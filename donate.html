                      <p>Volunteers bring priceless value to our community.  They offer their time and energy working on

                        and works to reward volunteers with: vouchers for food and gas on workdays; by supplying delicious
                        refreshments at the end of trail work days; assuring their tools are sharp and safe to use; and,
                        by hosting an annual volunteer appreciation party.  Your donation can help us thank our community
                        of volunteers.

                      <h2>Adopt-a-Trail Fund</h2>
                      <p>Through our various partnerships, we are authorized to maintain and rebuild many trails in Mariposa,
                        for example the renowned Hite’s Cove Wildflower Trail.  While building and maintaining trails is fun
                        and rewarding in itself, Mariposa Trails takes the extra step to promote use of the trails, namely
                        through recreation, races and education.  Helping to fund trail work and use of one of your favorite
                        trail is a great reason and great way to support our work and the volunteers that make it happen.

                      <h2>Matching Dollars for Grants Fund</h2>
                      <p>Since 2014, Mariposa Trails has contributed thousands of hours of volunteer time to rebuild public
                        trails that would not have been maintained without us.  Essential to this work was the award of a
                        grant to purchase trail tools and personnel protective equipment.  As with that grant, most grants
                        require a fiscal contribution from applicants.  Absent a ready supply of grant-match funds, the work
                        our volunteers performed would not have happened.  Help us be competitive and ready to obtain the
                        funds we need to create trails and activities for our community.

                      <p>This fund is used to promote the Mariposa Trails organization; a donation here is a great way to
                        multiply the dollars we receive from other funding options.  Funds are used for shirts, mugs,
                        hats, trail advertising signs, and community tabling events.

                        where funds are most needed, then this is the fund for you.  Rest assured, the fund will be placed
                        where needed, and will not be used to exceed the staff stipend listed in the 2020 budget.
