            <h2>Donations</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>MARIPOSA TRAILS is intentional about maintaining low overhead, is steadfast in our support and
              value of volunteers, and, maximizes our productivity through partnerships and grantors. In spite
              of this, financial support is essential to sustain our work in the community. </p>
            
            <p>MARIPOSA TRAILS offers various fund options that allow donors to specify how their dollars spent.
              You chose which fund or funds you’d like to contribute to.  You could also specify a favorite trail
              that you’d like to be cared for.  No matter how you slice it, we are thankful and respectful of your
              choice as your financial contribution is a win for you, MARIPOSA TRAILS and the community.</p>

          <h2>Sustaining Fund</h2>
          <p>This fund pays for overhead costs, promotional materials and essential day-to-day functions of
            MARIPOSA TRAILS, including organizing and leading “Tending the Trail” work outings; managing race
            and recreation events; obtaining and managing grants; coordinating with partners; conducting public
            outreach; promoting MARIPOSA TRAILS; and, securing fiscal sponsorships.

          <h2>Volunteer Rewards Fund</h2>
          <p>To show our appreciation for the time and energy that trail volunteers provide our community,
            MARIPOSA TRAILS rewards volunteers by covering many costs to host trail work days, including
            delicious refreshments at the end of trail work days, trail tools and personal protective
            equipment. We also throw an annual volunteer appreciation party at the end of the season.
            Help us thank our volunteers by making a donation to this fund.

          <h2>Matching Grants Fund</h2>
          <p>Since 2014, MARIPOSA TRAILS has contributed thousands of hours of volunteer time to rebuild community
            trails. This would not have been possible, however, without grant funds that were used to purchase trail
            tools and personnel protective equipment. Most grants require a substantive fiscal contribution or match
            from applicants, however. Donate dollars to this fund to enable us to be able to obtain grant funds we
            need to create trails and activities for our community.
