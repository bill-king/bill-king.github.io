          <h2>Volunteer Rewards Fund</h2>
          <p>Volunteers bring priceless value to our community. They offer their time and energy working on
            trails, at race and recreation events, as well as general support. Mariposa trails is grateful
            and works to reward volunteers with vouchers for food and gas on workdays, by supplying delicious
            refreshments at the end of trail work days, assuring their tools are sharp and safe to use, and,
            by hosting an annual volunteer appreciation party. Your donation can help us thank our community
            of volunteers.

          <h2>Adopt-a-Trail Fund</h2>
          <p>Through our various partnerships, we are authorized to maintain and rebuild many trails in Mariposa,
            for example the renowned Hite’s Cove Wildflower Trail. While building and maintaining trails is fun
            and rewarding in itself, Mariposa Trails takes the extra step to promote use of the trails, namely
            through recreation, races and education. Helping to fund trail work and use of one of your favorite
            trail is a great reason and great way to support our work and the volunteers that make it happen.

          <h2>Matching Dollars for Grants Fund</h2>
          <p>Since 2014, Mariposa Trails has contributed thousands of hours of volunteer time to rebuild public
            trails that would not have been maintained without us. Essential to this work was the award of a
            grant to purchase trail tools and personnel protective equipment. Most grants, however, require a fiscal
            contribution from applicants. Absent a ready supply of grant-match funds, the work
            our volunteers performed would not have happened. Help us be competitive and ready to obtain the
            funds we need to create trails and activities for our community.

          <h2>Promotion Fund</h2>
          <p>This fund is used to promote the Mariposa Trails organization; a donation here is a great way to
            multiply the dollars we receive from other funding options. Funds are used for shirts, mugs,
            hats, trail advertising signs, and community tabling events.

          <p>If you believe all these funds are important, and wish to leave it up to Mariposa Trails to decide
            where funds are most needed, then this is the fund for you. Rest assured, the fund will be placed
            where needed, and will not be used to exceed the staff stipend listed in the 2020 budget.
