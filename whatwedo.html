            <h2>Tend the Trails</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>While Mariposa County is home to Yosemite National Park, it also contains other public lands that are
              closer to its citizens and less crowded. Mariposa Trails has stepped up to tend front-country trails for
              the
              enjoyment of all types of nature-based recreation, including hikers, cyclists, runners and equestrians.
              Most outings are in the fall and winter, when the soil is soft, the air is cool, and
              bugs are nowhere to be seen!

          <h2>Create Outdoor Recreational Opportunities</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>The livelihood of Mariposa County is rooted in the abundant richness of its land, which attracts and
            nourishes
            tourists and residents alike. Recognizing this, MARIPOSA TRAILS aims to provide access to outdoor
            recreational
            trails for the community. Our strategy is two-fold: tend the trails AND promote their use. To this end, we
            organize
            hiking, backpacking, biking and running trips, as well as race events. Proceeds from these activities are
            invested
            in trail network improvements and recreation and education programs. </p>

            <h2>Engage Youth</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Mariposa Trails seeks to involve local youth and area college students in its endeavors to improve their
              physical and mental health, and to expand their knowledge and skills. For example, Mariposa County High
              School students crafted the post-fire South Fork Trail Signs, and students from Central Valley
              Universities regularly participate in multi-day trail stewardship outings. </p>

          <hr>
          <p>The condition of trails is largely defined by the attention given to them by government agencies and their
            planning documents. Hence, Mariposa Trails seeks to form strong and positive partnerships with government
            agencies; to be active participants in the development and implementation of planning documents; and, to
            encourage and support community and local partner involvement in all planning efforts related to local
            trails. </p>
