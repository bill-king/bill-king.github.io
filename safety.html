            <h2><a id="personal-safety">Personal Safety</a></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>1. Review Posted Safety Information. Before the work day event, be sure you have read and understood the
              safety-related
              information and instructions that are posted at mariposatrails.org.</p>
            <p>2. Age Restriction. Children under 18 years of age are not permitted on “trail tending days.”</p>
            <p>3. Don’t perform work your body is not ready for. You and your doctor know your body best. Don’t be afraid
              to
              speak up or decline to participate if you believe you cannot perform any travel or requested task. It is
              your
              responsibility to be able to undertake the physical challenges presented in the outing, or to opt out.</p>
            <p>4. Be Certified/Trained as appropriate. Be sure you are properly trained and certified before cutting
              either
              standing or fallen trees with a chainsaw or crosscut saw.</p>
            <p>5. Wear the right personal protective equipment: MARIPOSA TRAILS will provide gloves, hard-hat and safety
              glasses; each volunteer will need to supply other items:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- Gloves: Work gloves are necessary to grip tools as well as to protect the hands from blisters,
                thorny brush, poison oak, or any other minor scratches associated with trail work. </li>
              <li>- Long pants & Long-sleeve shirts: Long pants and long-sleeve shirts should be worn as well to
                protect the skin from these hazards.</li>
              <li>- Hard Hat: Protective headgear (hard hats) are to be worn at all times when working on the trail
                as there could be danger of falling debris from: 1) above the work area [tree canopy or falling
                rocks]); 2) accidental falls; 3) other forms of released energy; or, 4) due to the actions of
                nearby volunteers.</li>
              <li>- Sturdy Footwear: Sturdy shoes or boots protect your feet from glancing tools and provide good
                nonskid footing when working.</li>
              <li>- Safety Glasses: Safety glasses should be worn when using power tools, breaking rock, or anywhere
                flying debris is present.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>6. Bring essential personal gear. MARIPOSA TRAILS will provide a trauma-level first-aid kit; each
              volunteer will need to supply other items:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>-Trauma-level First Aid Kit: The contents of this kit will
                include, among other items,  gloves, extra water, trauma pads, large gauze dressing pads,
                triple antibiotic ointment, antiseptic towelettes, tweezers, tape, bandages, shears, and medications. </li>
              <li>- First Aid Kit: A standard first aid kit should contain the basic components to handle minor
                incidents
                (blisters, splinters, small cuts, etc.) that may occur during a workday.</li>
              <li>- Water and Food: All workers should carry adequate water and food supplies; crew leaders should carry
                extra water and/or water filters. Workers should minimize or stop work if there is not an adequate
                supply
                of drinking water at the worksite.</li>
              <li>- Protective Creams: Insect repellant and sun block are essential. Creams can be used as a pre- or
                post- treatment for poison oak or ivy exposure.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2><a id="tools">Tool Use</a></h2>
          <hr>
          <p>1. Prepare Tools</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Inspect hand tool condition before use. Make sure handles are sound, smooth, and straight, and that
              the
              heads are tight. </li>
            <li>- Make sure your tool is sharp. A dull tool that bounces or glances off of what it was attempting to cut
              can
              be very dangerous. A sharp tool will cut faster and be less tiring. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>2. Tools in Transport</p>
          <ul>
            <li>-Secure tools in vehicles. Load and unload tools with care. Avoid transporting tools loose in vehicles.
            </li>
            <li>- Carry the tool properly. Never carry tools over your shoulder. Always carry tools in your hands and
              down
              at your side on the downhill side of the trail, with blades forward and the handles behind.
              If you should slip, drop the tool to the side to prevent falling on the blade. </li>
            <li>- Space yourself along the trail. Stay at least 10 feet apart on the hike in and out from the work site.
            </li>
            <li>- Pass tools safely. Never throw a tool, and pass tools so others avoid grasping a cutting edge. </li>
            <li>- Create safe tool staging areas. Designate a central drop point for tools near the worksite so tools
              are
              less likely to be lost or accidentally stepped on. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>3. Tools in Use</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Work as a team. Productive, safe crews depend on each member being alert, informed, and caring.
              Every volunteer is responsible for working in a safe manner; it is not just a crew leader responsibility.
              Everyone needs to be aware of and point out unsafe practices and hazards to others. </li>
            <li>- Choose the right tool for the job. The wrong tool can make you work in an awkward stance which will
              wear you out.</li>
            <li>- Form a good grip. Wet or muddy gloves may cause a tool to slip from your hands, striking you or
              someone
              near you.</li>
            <li>- Be alert for hazardous footing. Make sure you have a firm, balanced, and comfortable stance before
              starting
              your work. Clear limbs, sticks, loose rocks, or other debris from your footing area. Particularly with
              striking
              tools—make sure your feet are spaced well away from your target area.</li>
            <li>- Watch out for people around you. When chopping or brushing, be aware of any people in the surrounding
              area.
              The combined length of your arm and tool could reach a person working near you. Also, be aware of trail
              users.
              Often a user may try to pass right into your back swing. If you see someone coming, stop work, notify your
              co-workers and wait for them to pass.</li>
            <li>- Make sure you have a clear area in which to swing. Watch out for overhead or side hazards. A hazard is
              anything that could interfere with the complete swing of your tool, and knock it from your hands or down
              onto
              any part of your body. Keep your tool in front of you at all times. You should never need to swing your
              tool
              over your head.</li>
            <li>- Be aware of the state of your mind and body. Stop working if you feel faint dizzy, exhausted or have
              any
              feeling of discomfort.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>4. Tool Care after Event</p>
          <ul>
            <li>-Protect tools. Store tools safely and out of the weather. </li>
            <li>- Maintain the Trail Tools. Identify tools that need maintenance; schedule time for repairing or
              replacing tools.</li>
