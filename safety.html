              <h2>Personal Safety</h2>
              <hr>
                      <p>1. Review Posted Safety Information. Before the work day event, be sure you have read and understood the safety-related
                       information and instructions that are posted at mariposatrails.org.</p>
                      <p>2. Age Restriction.  Children under 18 years of age are not permitted on “trail tending days.”</p>
                      <p>Don’t perform work your body is not ready for.  You and your doctor know your body best. Don’t be afraid to
                        speak up or decline to participate if you believe you cannot perform any travel or requested task.  It is your
                        responsibility to be able to undertake the physical challenges presented in the outing, or to opt out.</p>
                      <p>3. Be Certified/Trained as appropriate.  Be sure you are properly trained and certified before cutting either 
                        standing or fallen trees with a chainsaw or crosscut saw.</p>
                      <p>4. Wear the right personal protective equipment:Mariposa Trails is intentioyou, Mariposa Trails
                         and the community.  MARIPOSA TRAILS will provide gloves, hard-hat and safety glasses; each
                         volunteer will need to supply other items:</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>- Gloves: Work gloves are necessary to grip tools as well as to protect the hands from blisters,
                         thorny brush, poison oak or ivy, or any other minor scratches associated with trail work. </li>
                       <li>- Long pants & Long-sleeve shirts:  Long pants and long-sleeve shirts should be worn as well to
                         protect the skin from these hazards.</li>
                       <li>- Hard Hat:  Protective headgear (hard hats) are to be worn at all times when working on the trail
                         as there could be danger of falling debris from: 1) above the work area (tree canopy or falling
                         rocks); 2) accidental falls; 3) other forms of released energy; or, 4) due to the actions of
                         nearby volunteers.</li>
                       <li>- Sturdy Footwear:   Sturdy shoes or boots protect your feet from glancing tools and provide good
                         nonskid footing when working.</li>
                       <li>- Safety Glasses: Safety glasses should be worn when using power tools, breaking rock, or anywhere
                         flying debris is present.</li>
                       <p>5. Bring essential personal gear.  MARIPOSA TRAILS will provide a trauma-level first-aid kit; each
                         volunteer will need to supply other items:</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>-Trauma-level First Aid Kit:  In the event someone is severely injured, the contents of this kit will
                         include gloves, extra water, large gauze pads, antibiotic ointment, tweezers, tapes, Ibuprofen and
                         Benadryl. </li>
                       <li>- First Aid Kit:  A standard first aid kit should contain the basic components to handle minor incidents
                         (blisters, splinters, small cuts, etc.) that may occur during a workday.</li>
                       <li>- Water and Food:  All workers should carry adequate water and food supplies; crew leaders should carry
                         extra water and/or water filters. Workers should minimize or stop work if there is not an adequate supply
                         of drinking water at the worksite.</li>
                       <li>- Protective Creams:  Insect repellant and sun block are essential. Creams can be used as a pre- or
                         post- treatment for poison oak or ivy exposure.</li>
                     </ul>

              <h2>Tool Use</h2>
              <hr>
                      <p>1. Prepare Tools</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>- Inspect hand tool condition before use.  Make sure handles are sound, smooth, and straight, and that the
                         heads are tight. </li>
                       <li>- Make sure your tool is sharp.  A dull tool that bounces or glances off of what it was attempting to cut can
                         be very dangerous. A sharp tool will cut faster and be less tiring. </li>
  
                       <p>2. Tools in Transport</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>-Secure tools in vehicles.  Load and unload tools with care. Avoid transporting tools loose in vehicles.  </li>
                       <li>- Carry the tool properly.  Never carry tools over your shoulder.  Always carry tools in your hands and down
                         at your side on the downhill side of the trail, with blades forward and the handles behind. 
                         If you should slip, drop the tool to the side to prevent falling on the blade.  </li>
                       <li>- Space yourself along the trail.  Stay at least 10 feet apart on the hike in and out from the work site.</li>
                       <li>- Pass tools safely.  Never throw a tool, and pass tools so others avoid grasping a cutting edge. </li>
                       <li>- Create safe tool staging areas.  Designate a central drop point for tools near the worksite so tools are
                         less likely to be lost or accidentally stepped on. </li>
                       
                     <p>3. Tools in Use</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>- Work as a team.  Productive, safe crews depend on each member being alert, informed, and caring. 
                         Every volunteer is responsible for working in a safe manner; it is not just a crew leader responsibility.
                         Everyone needs to be aware of and point out unsafe practices and hazards to others. </li>
                       <li>- Choose the right tool for the job.  The wrong tool can make you work in an awkward stance which will
                         wear you out..</li>
                       <li>- Form a good grip.  Wet or muddy gloves may cause a tool to slip from your hands, striking you or someone
                         near you.</li>
                       <li>- Be alert for hazardous footing. Make sure you have a firm, balanced, and comfortable stance before starting
                         your work. Clear limbs, sticks, loose rocks, or other debris from your footing area. Particularly with striking
                         tools—make sure your feet are spaced well away from your target area.</li>
                       <li>- Watch out for people around you. When chopping or brushing, be aware of any people in the surrounding area.
                         The combined length of your arm and tool could reach a person working near you. Also, be aware of trail users.
                         Often a user may try to pass right into your back swing. If you see someone coming, stop work, notify your
                         co-workers and wait for them to pass.</li>
                       <li>- Make sure you have a clear area in which to swing. Watch out for overhead or side hazards. A hazard is
                         anything that could interfere with the complete swing of your tool, and knock it from your hands or down onto
                         any part of your body. Keep your tool in front of you at all times. You should never need to swing your tool
                         over your head.</li>
                       <li>- Be aware of the state of your mind and body.  Stop working if you feel faint dizzy, exhausted or have any
                         feeling of discomfort.</li>
  
                       <p>4. Tool Care after Event</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>-Protect tools.  Store tools safely and out of the weather. </li>
                       <li>- Maintain the Trail Tools.  Identify tools that need maintenance; schedule time for repairing or
                         replacing tools.</li>
                     </ul>
                     </ul>

                      <p>Volunteers bring priceless value to our community.  They offer their time and energy working on
                        trails, at race and recreation events, as well as general support.  Mariposa trails is grateful
                        and works to reward volunteers with vouchers for food and gas on workdays, by supplying delicious
                        refreshments at the end of trail work days, assuring their tools are sharp and safe to use, and,
                        by hosting an annual volunteer appreciation party.  Your donation can help us thank our community
                        of volunteers.
