          <p>Volunteers bring priceless value to our community. They offer their time and energy working on
            trails, at race and recreation events, as well as general support. Mariposa trails is grateful
            and works to reward volunteers with vouchers for food and gas on workdays, by supplying delicious
            refreshments at the end of trail work days, assuring their tools are sharp and safe to use, and,
            by hosting an annual volunteer appreciation party. Your donation can help us thank our community
            of volunteers.
