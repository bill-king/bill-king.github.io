          <h2>Donations</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Mariposa Trails works with our local partners to provide trail planning, maintenance expertise, project
            grant funding, and volunteer recruitment to augment lack of public funding for trails. Since 2014, Mariposa
            trails has contributed thousands of hours of volunteer work and helped rebuild public trails that would not
            have been maintained without us. Without equipment, match funds for grants, and admin support, however, the
            work our volunteers perform would not happen. Thatâ€™s why donations, fundraising and support from local
            businesses is so important. Your financial support is a crucial part of the success of Mariposa Trails. You
            can donate online or through the mail.

          <h2>Memberships</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Membership is free. Recognizing the value that volunteers bring to Mariposa Trails, we are committed to
            offering events at no cost to them; volunteers should not have to pay to participate. Plus, Mariposa Trails
            actively seeks ways to support volunteer efforts by seeking food and gas vouchers, and by supplying
            delicious refreshments at the end of all trail work days.
